/*
A zigzag path is:
Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction.
If the current direction is right, move to the right child;
otherwise, move to the left child.
Repeat until you can't move in the tree.

Zigzag path length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1.
Return the longest zigzag path contained in that tree.
